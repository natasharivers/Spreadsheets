SPREADSHEETS = EXCEL

REASONS TO USE EXCEL:
- you CANNOT escape spreadsheets in the corporate world
- may specifically ask for spreadsheet if they want to later manipulate the data
- working with others (colaberating), multiple people working on the same sheet at the same time
 

LIMITATIONS (CONS) OF EXCEL:
- limits to data you can enter
    * Max Excel holds: 16384 columns & 1.04M rows
- uses a lot of RAM
- limited charts
- have to re-run cells if you add data
- in coding: its very structured, in excel: the order doesnt really matter (not as structured)
- no error messages
- easy to permanently ruin your spreadsheet


BENEFITS (PROS) OF EXCEL:
- easy to learn
- easy to share with others
- faster for "small" datasets

Keyboard commands:
command + A - select all data
command + A + A - selects entire spreadsheet
command + shift + down arrow - highlight all rows below where curser is 
command + shift + up arrow - highlight all rows below where curser is 


Share:
- Permissions:
    *viewers- can only see and make copy
    *commenter- can add notes but not edit 
    *editor- can manipulate data
- can "get link" and share your doc with anyone you want

SPREADSHEET WALKTROUGH:
"Movie Data"
1. Format: look at column titles - format appropriately (currency,date,etc)
2. Dates: should be YYYY-MM-DD
3. Currency: if dealing with large numbers (in millions), use rounded Currency

4. Duplicates: 
    -select all, 
    -go to "data", 
    -click "remove duplicates"

5. Copy: 
    -right click on lower tab, 
    -"duplicate" - to have original data in another tab

6. Remove White Space: 
    -data tab
    - trim whitespace

7. Sort Data: 
    - data tab, 
    - sort range, 
    - advance sorting, 
    - "data has header"

8. Filtering: 
    - data tab, 
    - create filer, 
    - creates an inverted triangle on header
    - click triangle and choose option
    - if want gone: data, remove Filter

9. Filter Views: 
    - go to data tab
    - click filter views, create
    - filter as needed
    - save as new name 

10. Create new column
    - right click and insert

11. Data Validation
    - for consistent data 
        - data tab
        - data validation 
        - criteria: list of items (yes, no)
        - save

12. Count if, sum if, average if
    - will only count if condition is true
    - countif(range, criteria)
    _ sumif(range,criteria, sum_range)
    - averageif(range, criteria, average_range)

13. Lock in function
    - $ before and after range
        - sumif($G2:$G500)
            -this will remain ($G2:$G500) even if you drag formula down

14. Pivot Table
    - data tab
    - pivot table
    - "new sheet" - always suggested
        -(ex): ROWS- add genre
                    -add year

             VALUES- add budget (average)
                    -add BO revenue (average)

    - Color Scaling:
        - select column desired
        - Format tab
        - conditional formating
        - color scale

    - Charts:

        - select "chart type"

16. VLookup
    - must be leftmost column
    - =VLOOKUP(reference search cell, $column$row:$column$row, index, False)
